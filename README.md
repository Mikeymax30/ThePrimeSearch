It is known that this code is inneffecient; It was created as an experiement to test the fact that every prime number squared is one less than a multiple of 24. I had the thought of reversingthis process.
If you are looking for a more effecient program, Aarons Sieve of Eratosthenes works more effeiently and shares a similar way of testing prime numbers.
